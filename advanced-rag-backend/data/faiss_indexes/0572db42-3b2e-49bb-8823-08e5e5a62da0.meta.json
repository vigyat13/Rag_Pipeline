What is DBMS? Explain advantages.\nA DBMS (Database Management System) is software that manages storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data.\nAdvantages:\n- Reduces data redundancy\n- Ensures data consistency\n- Provides security\n- Allows concurrency control\n- Ensures backup and recovery\nQ2. Difference between DBMS and RDBMS.\nDBMS: Stores data as files, no relations. Examples: XML DB.\nRDBMS: Stores data in tables with relations. Uses SQL. Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL.\nQ3. Explain keys in DBMS.\n- Primary Key: Unique identifier\n- Candidate Key: All possible unique keys\n- Alternate Key: Candidate keys not chosen as PK\n- Foreign Key: References PK of another table\n- Composite Key: Combination of attributes\n- Super Key: Any set uniquely identifying tuples\nQ4. What is Normalization?\nNormalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy.\n1NF: Atomic values\n2NF: No partial dependency\n3NF: No transitive dependency\nBCNF: Eve"}, {"chunk_id": "47c13334-c679-4f2b-bacc-e48ecd2d5ddc", "document_id": "93932129-c067-4d6f-b4c2-d0b3ce1667d0", "filename": "DBMS_SQL_Interview_Bible.pdf", "text": "dentifying tuples\nQ4. What is Normalization?\nNormalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy.\n1NF: Atomic values\n2NF: No partial dependency\n3NF: No transitive dependency\nBCNF: Every determinant must be a candidate key\nQ5. What is Denormalization?\nDenormalization = introducing redundancy for faster queries. Used in OLAP systems.\n\nQ6. What is a Transaction? Explain ACID properties.\nTransaction = logical unit of work.\nACID: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability\nQ7. Explain Concurrency problems.\nProblems: Dirty Reads, Non-repeatable Reads, Phantom Reads.\nQ8. What are Isolation Levels?\nRead Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable\nQ9. What is Deadlock? How to handle?\nDeadlock = circular wait for resources. Solutions: Prevention, Detection, Avoidance\nQ10. Difference between OLTP and OLAP.\nOLTP = short transactions (banking). OLAP = analytical queries (data warehouse).\nSQL Query Questions\nQ16.
